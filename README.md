# Projects & Challenges

## [Instagram Clone Project](https://github.com/Tiago-B-C-Reis/SQL_Projects_and_Courses/tree/main/Project_Instagram_Clone)
This MySQL project is a replicated version of the Instagram database, specifically created for conducting data analysis on real-world business inquiries and scenarios. This includes the following:
+ Identifying an appropriate rewards system for loyal users.
+ Launching targeted campaigns to attract users during weekdays with the highest registration rates.
+ Developing strategies to encourage inactive users to resume system usage.
+ And other related business-oriented inquiries. 


## [Project World Population](https://github.com/Tiago-B-C-Reis/SQL_Projects_and_Courses/tree/main/Project_World_Population)
In this project, I analyzed the world population data using the dataset from CIA World Factbook. The dataset consists of 17 columns and 234 rows, with variables such as Country_id, Country_Territory, Capital, Continent, Population_2022 to 1970, Area, Density, Growth_Rate and World_Population_Percentage.
I used SQL in MySQL Workbench to answer analytical questions such as:
+ Which countries have the highest and lowest population densities?
+ Which country has the current highest population?
+ Which country is witnessing the highest population growth?
+ What is the total population number by Continents?
+ What is the density number by Continents?
+ Which countries have experienced the fastest population growth over the years?
+ How has the world population changed over time?
+ In percentage, how much has the total population increased since 1970? and by Continent?
+ Is there a country with a negative birth rate?
+ How many people are there per square km on each continent?

This project not only helped me to gain hands-on experience in SQL, but also provided insights into the world population trends and patterns
